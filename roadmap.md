# SwiftUI Query - Development Roadmap

This document outlines the complete implementation roadmap for SwiftUI Query, organized by priority and implementation phases.

## Progress Summary

**Phase 1 - Foundation: ✅ COMPLETED**
- Core Types & Protocols: ✅ COMPLETED (Tasks 1-5)
- Cache Infrastructure: ✅ COMPLETED (Tasks 6-7)
- Core Query Engine: ✅ COMPLETED (Tasks 9, 11-12)
- SwiftUI Integration: ✅ COMPLETED (Tasks 14-15)

**Current Status**: 12 of 25 core tasks completed (48%)
- 130 comprehensive unit tests passing
- Swift 6 strict concurrency compliance verified
- Perception library integrated for iOS 16+ compatibility
- Basic useQuery functionality working in SwiftUI

## Phase 1: Foundation (High Priority)

### Core Types & Protocols
- [x] **Task 1**: Create foundational types (QueryKey protocol, RetryConfig, RefetchTriggers/RefetchOnAppear, QueryMeta)
- [x] **Task 2**: Implement QueryState and FetchStatus enums
- [x] **Task 3**: Create QueryOptions and InfiniteQueryOptions structs
- [x] **Task 4**: Implement InfiniteData struct for pagination
- [x] **Task 5**: Create QueryObserverIdentifier and QueryError types

### Cache Infrastructure
- [x] **Task 6**: Implement thread-safe Mutex actor for cache synchronization
- [x] **Task 7**: Create QueryCache class with thread-safe operations

### Core Query Engine
- [x] **Task 9**: Create Query class with state management and lifecycle
- [x] **Task 11**: Create QueryClient class with query management methods
- [x] **Task 12**: Implement QueryObserver class with reactive state

### SwiftUI Integration
- [x] **Task 14**: Implement QueryClientProvider singleton and environment setup
- [x] **Task 15**: Create UseQuery SwiftUI view component

## Phase 2: Extended Features (Medium Priority)

### Infinite Query Support
- [ ] **Task 10**: Implement InfiniteQuery class for pagination support
- [ ] **Task 13**: Create InfiniteQueryObserver class with pagination methods
- [ ] **Task 16**: Implement UseInfiniteQuery SwiftUI view component

### Lifecycle Monitoring
- [ ] **Task 17**: Create AppLifecycleMonitor for app foreground/background detection
- [ ] **Task 18**: Implement NetworkMonitor for connectivity changes

### Advanced Features
- [ ] **Task 8**: Implement MutationCache class (basic structure)
- [ ] **Task 19**: Add retry logic with exponential backoff
- [ ] **Task 20**: Implement garbage collection timers for inactive queries
- [ ] **Task 21**: Add refetch interval timers and background handling
- [ ] **Task 23**: Add query invalidation and refetch methods

### Quality Assurance
- [x] **Task 24**: Create comprehensive unit tests for foundational types (28 tests passing)
- [ ] **Task 24b**: Create unit tests for remaining components (cache, observers, etc.)

## Phase 3: Optimization & Polish (Low Priority)

### Performance Optimizations
- [ ] **Task 22**: Implement structural sharing for data optimization

### Documentation
- [ ] **Task 25**: Add DocC documentation for all public APIs

## Implementation Guidelines

### Dependencies
Each phase builds upon the previous:
- Phase 1 provides the foundation for all query operations
- Phase 2 adds advanced features and lifecycle management
- Phase 3 focuses on performance and documentation

### Key Requirements
- Swift 6 strict concurrency mode compatible
- Built with Perception library for iOS 16 compatibility
- Zero external dependencies beyond Perception
- Match TanStack Query's architecture and behavior

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all public APIs
- Integration tests for SwiftUI components
- Performance tests for cache operations
- Memory leak tests for observers and timers

### Architecture Principles
1. **Observer Pattern**: Reactive updates using Perception
2. **Stale-While-Revalidate**: Show cached data while refetching
3. **Thread Safety**: All operations are Sendable and thread-safe
4. **Framework Agnostic Core**: Separate business logic from SwiftUI

## Milestone Checkpoints

### Milestone 1: Basic Query Functionality ✅ COMPLETED
Complete Phase 1 tasks 1-7, 9, 11-12, 14-15
- ✅ Basic useQuery equivalent working in SwiftUI
- ✅ Thread-safe caching system
- ✅ Query lifecycle management

### Milestone 2: Feature Complete
Complete Phase 2 tasks 8, 10, 13, 16-21, 23-24
- Infinite query support
- App lifecycle integration
- Advanced query features
- Comprehensive test coverage

### Milestone 3: Production Ready
Complete Phase 3 tasks 22, 25
- Performance optimizations
- Complete documentation
- Ready for public release

## Success Criteria

Each task must meet:
- [ ] Compiles with Swift 6 strict concurrency
- [ ] Matches corresponding TanStack Query behavior
- [ ] Includes unit tests
- [ ] Follows SwiftUI best practices
- [ ] Uses Perception for state management

## Reference Implementation

Always reference TanStack Query source code in `Documentation/query/packages/`:
- `query-core/src/` - Core logic and architecture
- `react-query/src/` - Framework integration patterns

Adapt TypeScript patterns to Swift idioms while maintaining behavioral consistency.
