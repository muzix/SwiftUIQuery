# SwiftUI Query - Development Roadmap

## Overview
Based on the API design and core principles, this roadmap outlines the systematic development of SwiftUI Query as a Swift implementation of TanStack Query for SwiftUI applications.

## Phase 1: Foundation & Core Types (Week 1)
**Goal**: Establish the basic infrastructure and type system

### 1.1 Project Setup
- [x] Initialize Swift package with proper structure
- [x] Configure Swift 6 strict concurrency settings (`-strict-concurrency=complete`)
- [x] Set up basic test infrastructure with XCTest
- [x] Create initial documentation structure with DocC

### 1.2 Core Type Definitions
- [x] Define `QueryKey` protocol (`Hashable` conformance)
- [x] Implement `QueryStatus` enum (`.idle`, `.loading`, `.success`, `.error`)
- [x] Create `QueryState<T: Sendable>` struct with `@Observable` macro
- [x] Define `RefetchTrigger` enum (`.never`, `.always`, `.ifStale`, `.when(() -> Bool)`)
- [x] Implement `ThrowOnError` enum (`.never`, `.always`, `.when((Error) -> Bool)`)

### 1.3 QueryOptions Structure
- [x] Implement complete `QueryOptions` struct with all TanStack Query equivalents:
  - `staleTime`, `gcTime`
  - `refetchOnAppear`, `refetchOnReconnect`, `refetchOnSceneActive`
  - `enabled`, `retry`, `throwOnError`, `networkMode`
- [x] Add sensible defaults matching TanStack Query behavior
- [x] Ensure all options are `Sendable` compliant

### 1.4 Error Handling Foundation
- [x] Implement `ReportErrorKey` environment key
- [x] Create `ErrorBoundary` view modifier
